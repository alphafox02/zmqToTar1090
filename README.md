# zmqToTar1090

zmqToTar1090 proxies traffic from a Sniffle receiver (https://github.com/alphafox02/Sniffle) to JSON data formatted for ingestion into tar1090. A lot of this project was borrowed from alphafox (cemaexecutor)

## Features

## Requirements
- Sniffle compatible dongle
- tar1090 with local mountpoint to /run/readsb (use docker - https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-tar1090)
- python3

## Setup and Usage

### Setup tar1090 for drone ingestion

#### Dockerfile

- Append `TAR1090_CONFIGJS_APPEND='droneJson="./data/drone.json"'` to the ENV section of the docker-tar1090 Dockerfile

#### Docker Compose

- Append `TAR1090_CONFIGJS_APPEND='droneJson="./data/drone.json"'` to the "environment" section of the docker-compose-tar1090.yml file

### Clone Sniffle from alphafox02 repo (this it the one I used, you can likely use the one he forked from kerler)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alphafox02/Sniffle
cd Sniffle
```

### Run sniffle providing ZMQ output
```sh
python3 Sniffle/python_cli/sniff_receiver -l -e -z --zmqhost 127.0.0.1 --zmqport 2402
```

This command configures the Sniffle dongle to look for Bluetooth 5 long range extended packets and forwards them via ZeroMQ (ZMQ).

### Start the zmqToTar1090 proxy with the expected ZMQ server/port information.

The following command specifies the ZMQ host and ZMQ port that are default

```sh
python3 zmqToTar1090.py --zmq-host 127.0.0.1 --zmqport 24042
```

This will create a `drone.json` file in the /run/readsb directory for ingestion into tar1090 The path will be parameterized soon.

You can use ```python3 zmqToTar10909.py --help``` to show runtime arguments
