# zmqToTar1090

zmqToTar1090 proxies traffic from a Sniffle receiver (https://github.com/alphafox02/Sniffle) to JSON data formatted for ingestion into tar1090. A lot of this project was borrowed from alphafox (cemaexecutor)

## Features

## Requirements
- Sniffle compatible dongle
- tar1090 with local mountpoint to /run/readsb (use docker - https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-tar1090)
- python3

### Start the zmqToTar1090 proxy with the expected ZMQ server/port information.

The following command specifies the ZMQ host and ZMQ port that are default

```sh
sudo python3 zmqToTar1090.py
```

This will create a `drone.json` file in the /run/readsb directory for ingestion into tar1090 The path will be parameterized soon.

You can use ```python3 zmqToTar10909.py --help``` to show runtime arguments

## Testing

I created a separate script you can run if you don't yet have a Sniffle compatible dongle. You'll still need tar1090 and the zmqToTar1090 script.

For more information, see the README in that folder
